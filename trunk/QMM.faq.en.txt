Frequently Asked Questions
------------------------------------
QMM current version: BETA v1.12
I hope more people can see, and suggest a or BUG, thank you.

------------------------------------
explain the name:
------------------------------------
Serial MM: FastMM, TopMM
  Serial MM, is based on multithread, in the multi thread memory operation, 
  all the operations are performed in synchronous mode, i call it serial MM.

Parallel MM: ScaleMM, QMM, SAPMM
  In parallel, multithreaded memory operation, is assigned a memory management mode, 
  so, A and B thread at the same time distribution, will not interfere with each other.
  serial MM and parallel MM biggest difference lies in the. 
  That is, when different MM in the same test content, efficiency and memory usage for different reasons there will be.

------------------------------------

Q: which MM is the most stable, the most appropriate production and development?

A: (this is a personal opinion, for reference only)
  I present test case, use the FastMM+multithread pool mode of production development.

  On the server side aspects of the procedure can be considered: ScaleMM2.0, or SAPMM.

  TOPMM, indeed, Fastcode MM benchmark process, it is the fastest, but when reading code is that it is almost FastMM,
  and is the serial MM, and less than FastMM on DEBUG, so...

  QMM is the initial development is from 2013-9, from reading the ScaleMM2 began to do, 
  just interested, i wrote that.
  NOW it passed the fastcode mm benchmark test.
